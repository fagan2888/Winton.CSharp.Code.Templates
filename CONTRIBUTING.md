# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with changes.

## Filing issues
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal example with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
2. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
3. What IDE are you using?

GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) in issues, so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Contributing templates
Make sure you can build the code that a template generates.
Familiarize yourself with the C# coding conventions in existing templates.

If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

Before submitting a template or substantial contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. You might also read these two blog posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. Note that all submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Winton team prior to merging.
